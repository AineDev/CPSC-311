====================== THEORY =======================

1. Why couldn't we call the define-type variant for rename just
'rename', but instead we had to find a different name, like
'rename-as'?

TODO (your answer)

2. Provide a test case using lazy-with that, if all lazy-with 's are
changed to with, would produce a runtime error instead of a value.

TODO (your answer)

3. The language in this assignment is still a small language.  Can you
think of a kind of program that cannot be written yet in our language?
Why?

TODO (Your answer)

======================= BONUS =======================

If you attempted any bonuses, please note it here and describe how you
approached them.

TODO

Bonus theory question: Java has no "rename", but it is a feature that,
in a particular context, has been repeatedly requested to be added to
the language.  Can you think of a use for a "rename"-like feature in a
language like Java, which would let you do things that are currently
impossible in Java?
